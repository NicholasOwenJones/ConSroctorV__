As part of a Generation Data Engineering Bootcamp, we were encouraged to do a presentation to the rest of the class about ourselves, a passion or an interest of ours. Simply because of the number of students on the course, we ended up having several days where everyone had presented and there were still spaces to fill, so I volunteered to "present". 

This repo is the first clue in a treasure hunt that the other students played through in teams. The Python code is written in such a way that it is not easy to read (this is on purpose, please don't hate me!) and it is much faster to simply pull the project and run the code. Doing so will give you two paths to follow and lead you to a single Google Maps location which, at the time, the student teams were asked to screenshot and put in our group chat.

The overall feedback on this was very positive and I think everyone had fun.

The treasure hunt takes 30 mins to an hour and I would recommend having groups of 4-5 technically capable people play it.

Apologies in advance if you are playing this in the future and the links have broken.

Best of luck,
Nick
